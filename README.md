# To-Do List

## Project Proposal

The proposed project is a personalized to-do list that allows the user to make tasks, keep track of tasks,
and remove tasks when they have completed the task. It will **not** make external calls, so users can limit 
all information to their own computers.

Users will be:
- public

I am interested in this project because I think that a local to-do list software with only local storage is
a step forward from externally hosted storage systems, and the privacy issues surrounding them. With local
storage, personal information is in the hands of the user.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to see all tasks in my to-do list.
- As a user, I want to be able to add a task to my to-do list.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete tasks from my to-do list.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as complete.
- As a user, I want to be able to modify tasks in my to-do list.
- As a user, I want to be able to clear all tasks from my to-do list.

### Data persistence

- As a user, I want to be able to save the current to-do list as a file.
- As a user, I want to be able to load one of the previously-saved to-do list files.
