# To-Do List

## Project Proposal

The proposed project is a personalized to-do list that allows the user to make tasks, keep track of tasks,
and remove tasks when they have completed the task. It will **not** make external calls, so users can limit 
all information to their own computers.

Users will be:
- public

I am interested in this project because I think that a local to-do list software with only local storage is
a step forward from externally hosted storage systems, and the privacy issues surrounding them. With local
storage, personal information is in the hands of the user.
